# android-simple-todo
My personal project which allow QA to train their skills for bugs finding and bug report.
Ideally for kids to keep track of their schedule.

This project will have bugs inside, so you can track quality of QA work.

* The the list of tasks for today
* Add/remove/update tasks
* Mark as done with password provided

* Login/logout
* Sync tasks between devices
* Reports (how many tasks was done as planned, how many tasks were delayed)
* Achievements (if user done all tasks in time he will be rewarded)

It's written with `react-native` + `redux`
